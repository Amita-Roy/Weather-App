# Weather App

> In this project I have used the API https://openweathermap.org/ for weather data. The current weather information is displayed for any city that we enter. Along with weather information, I'm fetching the air pollution data as well and displaying the quality of air from 1 to 5, Where 1 = Good, 2 = Fair, 3 = Moderate, 4 = Poor, 5 = Very Poor.

- I have used default Stockholm as a default city for the first load.
- I have used Axios to work with asynchronous data.
- I have used momentjs for a date, time, and timezone conversion
- Enter the city name to get the weather information.
- Weather icons are also changing as per the condition of the weather and as per the day or night.
- Temperature can be changed with the click of 'C' and 'F' to display in Celcius or Fahrenheit.
- App background is dynamic, as image will change as per the weather condition in the city.
- I will add loader functionality in future updates.
