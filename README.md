# Weather App

> In this project I have used the api https://openweathermap.org/ for weather data. The current weather information is displayed for a any city that we enter. Along with weather information, I'm fetching the air pollution data aas well and displaying the quality of air from 1 to 5, Where 1 = Good, 2 = Fair, 3 = Moderate, 4 = Poor, 5 = Very Poor.

- I have used a default Stockholm as a default city for first load.
- I have used Axios to work with asyncronous data.
- I have used momentjs for date, time and timezone conversion
- Enter the city name to get the weather information.
- Weather icons are also changing as per the condition of the weather and as per the day or night.
- Temerature can be changed on the click of 'C' and 'F' to display in Celcius or Farenheit.
